This repository contains the implementation of a research project on social media analytics, focusing on Twitter data collection, wrangling, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling. 
The goal is to investigate patterns in user behavior, sentiment, and engagement metrics, and to build machine learning models for prediction tasks such as tweet virality, sentiment classification, or topic trends.

**Data Acquisition & Wrangling**
  a. Collect raw Twitter data using the Twitter API / academic API.
  b. Preprocess and clean text (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization).
  c. Normalize metadata (user info, engagement metrics, timestamps).

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  a. Visualize distributions of likes, retweets, and replies.
  b. Perform time-series analysis of tweet activity

  **Predictive Modeling**
  a. Compare traditional ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forests, XGBoost) with deep learning approaches (LSTMs, Transformers).
